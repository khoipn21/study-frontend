# Route Tree Generation

## Common Issue

When adding new routes or changing route paths in TanStack Router, you may see TypeScript errors like:

```
Argument of type '"/path/here"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'undefined'.
```

## Solution

This happens because the route tree needs to be regenerated. TanStack Router uses code generation to create type-safe routes.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Development server**: If running `npm run dev` or `bun dev`, the route tree should auto-regenerate
2. **Manual generation**: Run the build process or restart the dev server
3. **Check routeTree.gen.ts**: This generated file should include your new routes

### Route Tree File

The generated route tree is typically at:

- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` (auto-generated, should not be edited manually)

### Development Workflow

1. Create/modify route files in `src/routes/`
2. Ensure the development server is running (it will auto-generate the route tree)
3. If TypeScript errors persist, restart the dev server
4. The route tree will include your new routes and TypeScript errors should resolve

### Important Notes

- Never manually edit `routeTree.gen.ts`
- The file should be in `.gitignore` if it's generated at build time
- Route paths in `createFileRoute()` must match the actual file-based route structure
