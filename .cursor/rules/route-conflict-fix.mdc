description: Fix for route path conflicts in TanStack Router

# Route Conflict Resolution

## Current Issue

Both `demo.form.simple.tsx` and `demo.form.address.tsx` are using the same route path `/demo/form`, causing TypeScript errors.

## Solution

Update the route paths to be unique:

### For demo.form.simple.tsx

```typescript
export const Route = createFileRoute('/demo/form/simple')({
  component: SimpleForm,
})
```

### For demo.form.address.tsx

```typescript
export const Route = createFileRoute('/demo/form/address')({
  component: AddressForm,
})
```

## Navigation Updates

Update the navigation links in [src/components/Header.tsx](mdc:src/components/Header.tsx):

```typescript
<Link to="/demo/form/simple">Simple Form</Link>
<Link to="/demo/form/address">Address Form</Link>
```

This ensures each route has a unique path and resolves the TypeScript conflict error.
